                            <h4>Project Background & Motivation</h4>
                            <p>Traditional Chinese New Year paintings represent one of China's most widely recognized national intangible cultural heritage projects, but they face inheritance challenges in modern society. We chose to use AI technology to empower New Year painting creation, allowing intangible cultural heritage to connect with modern life and continue the vitality and joy of traditional culture through innovative expressions.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Technical Innovation</h4>
                            <p>We proposed an Adaptive Deep Attention Style Transfer model (ADAST), combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with VGG-19 pre-trained models. The model combines low-level texture information with high-level semantic information at each layer through adaptive attention normalization (AdaAttN) modules to achieve precise style transfer.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Dataset & Training</h4>
                            <p>Using the MSCOCO dataset (approximately 330,000 images) for content images and the WikiArt dataset (approximately 81,000 artworks) for style images. All images are uniformly loaded as 512×512 and randomly cropped to 256×256 for data augmentation, ensuring the model can handle diverse input content.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Practical Application Results</h4>
                            <p>The project successfully created a user-friendly interface allowing users to upload daily photos and select New Year painting styles, generating personalized New Year painting works in seconds. The system not only maintains the artistic characteristics of traditional New Year paintings but also incorporates modern elements, achieving perfect integration of cultural inheritance and innovation.</p>

                            <p>Linear classification models are fundamental building blocks of machine learning, laying the foundation for deep neural networks. This study deeply analyzes the robustness and vulnerability of perceptron algorithms and support vector machines under various data conditions, providing theoretical guidance for model selection in practical applications.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Theoretical Contributions</h4>
                            <p>We provided detailed proofs of Novikoff's convergence theorem, demonstrating the convergence guarantee of perceptrons on linearly separable data, while analyzing the cycling theorem to explain the failure mechanism of perceptrons on non-linearly separable data. For SVMs, we analyzed their dual formulation and kernel trick, demonstrating their superiority under the maximum margin principle.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Experimental Design</h4>
                            <p>Designed a comprehensive experimental suite including sparsity tests, noise ratio tests, data range tests, biased data tests, and margin tests. Used 10-fold cross-validation on synthetic datasets with 500 samples across 5 different difficulty levels, ensuring statistical significance of results.</p>

                            <h4>Ensemble Role and Responsibilities</h4>
                            <p>As a clarinet section member in a large classical ensemble of approximately 50 musicians, I carry important woodwind section responsibilities. In symphonic works, the clarinet must complete technically demanding solo passages while maintaining harmonious unity with the entire woodwind section, requiring exceptional intonation control and tone blending abilities.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Performance Repertoire and Challenges</h4>
                            <p>Performance repertoire spans from Baroque to contemporary periods, including Tchaikovsky ballets, Beethoven symphonies, Saint-Saëns' "Danse Bacchanale", and Arturo Márquez's "Danzón No. 2". Each work presents different technical and musical demands for the clarinet, requiring mastery of diverse performance styles.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Charity Concert Significance</h4>
                            <p>Participating in charity concerts organized by the Yale Club of Shanghai, performing for 500+ audiences, represents not only a showcase of musical skills but also the embodiment of music's social value. Contributing to charitable causes through music gave me profound understanding of music's social responsibility and cultural transmission value.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Skills Development and Growth</h4>
                            <p>Four years of ensemble experience significantly improved sight-reading ability, chamber music skills, and stage presence. I learned to quickly adapt to different conductors' styles, mastered complex rhythm and intonation changes, and developed the ability to maintain focus and collaboration in large ensemble settings.</p>

                            <h4>Summer Program Experience Overview</h4>
                            <p>Carnegie Mellon University is one of America's top music conservatories, and its summer program brings together outstanding young musicians from around the world. In this high-level academic environment, I had the opportunity to encounter cutting-edge contemporary music concepts and performance techniques, expanding my musical horizons.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Contemporary Work "Rain" Challenges</h4>
                            <p>The performed contemporary clarinet solo "Rain" was an experimental work created by a fellow participant, employing sparse rubato feel and extended techniques such as flutter-tonguing. This piece challenged traditional performance methods, requiring performers to create unique melancholic atmospheres through precise tonal control and phrasing.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Mastering Extended Techniques</h4>
                            <p>Flutter-tonguing is a commonly used extended technique in modern clarinet works that produces unique tonal effects. Through specialized practice and guidance, I mastered the control method for this technique, learning how to organically combine technique with musical expression, not merely for show.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Expansion of Artistic Concepts</h4>
                            <p>This experience gave me profound understanding of contemporary music aesthetics, learning to transcend traditional interpretive frameworks and focus on shaping raw emotional texture through precise control of timbre and phrasing. This avant-garde musical approach has now been integrated into my future performance and composition work.</p>

                            <p>In the 4th Liszt International Youth Piano Competition, I performed Liszt's "Liebestraume", a romantic classic that demands both technical prowess and musical sensitivity. The competition required performers to not only possess solid technical foundation but also convey the deep emotional content and poetic expression of the work.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Classical Piano Foundation Training</h4>
                            <p>Classical piano training that began in elementary school laid a solid foundation for competition participation. I specialized in studying works by masters such as Chopin, Mozart, and Bach, particularly the complex chord progressions and other musical motifs in Chopin nocturnes, including the use of rubato and harmonic tension.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Exploring Lesser-Known Classical Works</h4>
                            <p>Beyond well-known pieces, I also deeply explored works by lesser-known classical composers, such as Sibelius' "Etude in A minor, Op. 76, No. 2". Through performing this piece, I learned to appreciate Sibelius' technique of using repetitive, rhythmic motifs and sudden dynamic changes to evoke tension and resilience.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Value of Competition Experience</h4>
                            <p>Competition experience not only improved performance skills but more importantly cultivated the psychological quality to maintain stable performance under pressure. I learned how to prepare for competitions, manage nervous emotions, and how to best showcase the artistic value of works within limited time.</p>
