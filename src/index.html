                            <h4>Project Inspiration</h4>
                            <p>During a visit to Yangzhou's traditional woodblock print workshop, I noticed how few young people were learning this 400-year-old craft. The master craftsman mentioned that each painting takes weeks to complete by hand, limiting how many people can experience this art form. This sparked my idea to use neural style transfer to make year painting aesthetics more accessible.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Technical Approach</h4>
                            <p>I modified the VGG-19 neural network to better capture the distinctive red and gold color palettes of traditional year paintings. The main challenge was preserving the bold, flat color regions typical of woodblock prints while avoiding the blurry artifacts common in style transfer. I added custom loss functions specifically for color preservation and edge sharpness.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Data Collection</h4>
                            <p>I spent weeks digitizing year paintings from three museum collections, focusing on Yangzhou and Suzhou styles. The dataset includes 200 high-resolution scans of authentic pieces from 1900-1950. For content images, I used everyday photos - family gatherings, street scenes, landscapes - to test how well traditional motifs translate to modern subjects.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Results and Impact</h4>
                            <p>The web interface I built has generated over 1,500 stylized images since launch. Users particularly love seeing their family photos rendered in the classical year painting style. A local cultural center in Shanghai now uses the tool for educational workshops, helping students understand traditional aesthetics through hands-on creation.</p>

                            <h4>Research Question</h4>
                            <p>My mentor assigned me to investigate why SVMs often outperform simpler perceptrons in real-world applications. Instead of just running standard benchmarks, I wanted to understand exactly when and why each algorithm breaks down. This became particularly interesting when I noticed that even basic perceptrons sometimes surprisingly beat SVMs on certain datasets.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Investigation Approach</h4>
                            <p>I systematically tested both algorithms under stress conditions: sparse data (removing 80% of features), heavy noise (up to 40% label corruption), and adversarially designed datasets. The most revealing experiment involved creating synthetic datasets where I could control the margin between classes - this showed exactly where perceptrons start failing.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Implementation Details</h4>
                            <p>I coded both algorithms from scratch in Python rather than using libraries, which helped me understand the mathematical differences. The perceptron implementation included several variants I found in research papers: voted perceptron, averaged perceptron, and margin perceptron. For SVMs, I implemented both linear and RBF kernels using quadratic programming.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Surprising Results</h4>
                            <p>SVMs won on 23 out of 25 test scenarios, but the two cases where perceptrons won were fascinating: extremely high-dimensional sparse text data and datasets with systematic labeling errors. These edge cases revealed that computational simplicity sometimes trumps mathematical sophistication, especially when training data is unreliable.</p>

                            <h4>The Venue</h4>
                            <p>House of Blues and Jazz sits in Shanghai's former French Concession, in a 1930s villa with original wood floors that creak during quiet ballads. Thursday nights are mine - 8pm to 9:30pm, six of us crammed on a stage barely big enough for the drums. The acoustic piano is a 1960s Yamaha that needs tuning weekly, but has this warm, slightly detuned charm that works perfectly for jazz.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Learning the Standards</h4>
                            <p>I spent months learning the Real Book inside out, but my breakthrough came from transcribing Bill Evans' "Waltz for Debby" recording note-by-note. His left-hand voicings completely changed how I think about chord progressions. Now I can comp behind solos with the same rootless voicings Evans used, and it makes the bass player's life so much easier.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Chinese Songs Project</h4>
                            <p>The idea started when our bassist jokingly played the "Jasmine Flower" melody during sound check. I spent the next month arranging it as a medium swing with reharmonized changes - turning simple folk melodies into sophisticated jazz standards. "Mo Li Hua" now features a walking bass line and space for improvisation, while still being recognizable to Chinese audiences.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Growing as a Player</h4>
                            <p>Four years of weekly gigs taught me things no amount of practice at home could. Like how to keep time when the drummer rushes, or how to signal key changes with just a glance. The best nights are when we're all listening so closely that the music seems to play itself - those moments when improvisation becomes conversation.</p>

                            <h4>Ensemble Role and Responsibilities</h4>
                            <p>As a clarinet section member in a large classical ensemble of approximately 50 musicians, I carry important woodwind section responsibilities. In symphonic works, the clarinet must complete technically demanding solo passages while maintaining harmonious unity with the entire woodwind section, requiring exceptional intonation control and tone blending abilities.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Performance Repertoire and Challenges</h4>
                            <p>Performance repertoire spans from Baroque to contemporary periods, including Tchaikovsky ballets, Beethoven symphonies, Saint-Saëns' "Danse Bacchanale", and Arturo Márquez's "Danzón No. 2". Each work presents different technical and musical demands for the clarinet, requiring mastery of diverse performance styles.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Charity Concert Significance</h4>
                            <p>Participating in charity concerts organized by the Yale Club of Shanghai, performing for 500+ audiences, represents not only a showcase of musical skills but also the embodiment of music's social value. Contributing to charitable causes through music gave me profound understanding of music's social responsibility and cultural transmission value.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Skills Development and Growth</h4>
                            <p>Four years of ensemble experience significantly improved sight-reading ability, chamber music skills, and stage presence. I learned to quickly adapt to different conductors' styles, mastered complex rhythm and intonation changes, and developed the ability to maintain focus and collaboration in large ensemble settings.</p>

                            <h4>Summer Program Experience Overview</h4>
                            <p>Carnegie Mellon University is one of America's top music conservatories, and its summer program brings together outstanding young musicians from around the world. In this high-level academic environment, I had the opportunity to encounter cutting-edge contemporary music concepts and performance techniques, expanding my musical horizons.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Contemporary Work "Rain" Challenges</h4>
                            <p>The performed contemporary clarinet solo "Rain" was an experimental work created by a fellow participant, employing sparse rubato feel and extended techniques such as flutter-tonguing. This piece challenged traditional performance methods, requiring performers to create unique melancholic atmospheres through precise tonal control and phrasing.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Mastering Extended Techniques</h4>
                            <p>Flutter-tonguing is a commonly used extended technique in modern clarinet works that produces unique tonal effects. Through specialized practice and guidance, I mastered the control method for this technique, learning how to organically combine technique with musical expression, not merely for show.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Expansion of Artistic Concepts</h4>
                            <p>This experience gave me profound understanding of contemporary music aesthetics, learning to transcend traditional interpretive frameworks and focus on shaping raw emotional texture through precise control of timbre and phrasing. This avant-garde musical approach has now been integrated into my future performance and composition work.</p>

                            <h4>Competition Repertoire and Challenges</h4>
                            <p>In the 4th Liszt International Youth Piano Competition, I performed Liszt's "Liebestraume", a romantic classic that demands both technical prowess and musical sensitivity. The competition required performers to not only possess solid technical foundation but also convey the deep emotional content and poetic expression of the work.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Classical Piano Foundation Training</h4>
                            <p>Classical piano training that began in elementary school laid a solid foundation for competition participation. I specialized in studying works by masters such as Chopin, Mozart, and Bach, particularly the complex chord progressions and other musical motifs in Chopin nocturnes, including the use of rubato and harmonic tension.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Exploring Lesser-Known Classical Works</h4>
                            <p>Beyond well-known pieces, I also deeply explored works by lesser-known classical composers, such as Sibelius' "Etude in A minor, Op. 76, No. 2". Through performing this piece, I learned to appreciate Sibelius' technique of using repetitive, rhythmic motifs and sudden dynamic changes to evoke tension and resilience.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Value of Competition Experience</h4>
                            <p>Competition experience not only improved performance skills but more importantly cultivated the psychological quality to maintain stable performance under pressure. I learned how to prepare for competitions, manage nervous emotions, and how to best showcase the artistic value of works within limited time.</p>

                            <h4>Research Background and Motivation</h4>
                            <p>The RAVE (Realtime Audio Variational autoEncoder) project emerged from my interest in bridging artificial intelligence and creative audio production. Rain sounds have unique acoustic properties that make them ideal for testing audio synthesis models - they combine stochastic noise elements with temporal patterns that challenge traditional synthesis approaches.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Technical Implementation and Innovation</h4>
                            <p>The RAVE architecture implements a two-stage training process: representation learning followed by adversarial fine-tuning. The encoder compresses audio into a compact latent representation, while the decoder reconstructs high-fidelity audio with multiband spectral distance optimization. I achieved a real-time factor of 0.23 and spectral reconstruction loss of 0.142, enabling real-time neural audio synthesis on standard hardware.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Model Architecture and Training Results</h4>
                            <p>The model features a convolutional encoder-decoder architecture with residual connections and spectral normalization for stable training. The training validation curves demonstrate consistent convergence across multiple loss components including adversarial loss, feature matching, and multiband spectral distance. The comparison between original and reconstructed spectrograms shows high-fidelity audio reconstruction with preserved spectral characteristics.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Creative Applications and Impact</h4>
                            <p>Beyond technical metrics, the synthesized rain sounds have been integrated into my electronic music compositions, particularly in "Walk in the Rain". The model enables real-time manipulation of rain texture and intensity, opening new possibilities for interactive audio experiences and adaptive soundscapes in multimedia applications.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Research Contributions and Future Work</h4>
                            <p>This work contributes to the growing field of neural audio synthesis by demonstrating effective techniques for environmental sound modeling. Future directions include extending the model to other natural sounds and exploring applications in virtual reality environments and therapeutic audio applications.</p>

                            <h4>Research Focus and Motivation</h4>
                            <p>During the Tencent Music Tech X Program, I investigated how digital audio processing could make music more accessible to people with hearing loss. The motivation came from learning that many hearing aid users experience distorted music playback, missing the emotional connection that music provides. This seemed like a perfect intersection of my technical skills and musical background.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Audio Processing Pipeline Development</h4>
                            <p>I built a custom audio processing chain that analyzes frequency content and dynamically adjusts EQ curves based on common hearing loss patterns. The system identifies which frequencies are typically lost in sensorineural hearing loss (usually high frequencies above 2kHz) and applies compensatory boosting while avoiding feedback-inducing resonances. Testing was done with both simulated hearing loss models and real hearing aid users.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Alzheimer's Awareness Project</h4>
                            <p>I composed and produced a 3-minute video soundtrack focusing on music therapy applications for dementia patients. The composition uses specific tempo ranges (60-80 BPM) and familiar harmonic progressions that research shows can trigger positive memories in Alzheimer's patients. The video received significant engagement on social platforms, validating the approach.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Technical Implementation</h4>
                            <p>The core system runs in real-time using Python with NumPy for FFT processing and PyAudio for low-latency playback. I implemented custom frequency response curves for popular hearing aid models (Phonak, Oticon, ReSound) and created an adaptive algorithm that learns from user feedback to fine-tune the processing parameters for individual listening preferences.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Impact and Results</h4>
                            <p>User testing showed a 40% improvement in music enjoyment scores among hearing aid users when using the processed audio. The Alzheimer's awareness video achieved over 800 views and positive feedback from healthcare workers. This project demonstrated how technology can bridge the gap between technical innovation and real human needs in healthcare.</p>
